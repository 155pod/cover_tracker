## Contributing

So far almost no one has been interested in contributing. But please do reach
out if you want to contribute and need help getting started.

Cover Tracker is a Ruby on Rails application, and Rails [has great guides for
getting started with the framework][2]. But before jumping into Rails,
you may want to learn about [Ruby][3] first. The `Gemfile` has code comments
that explain the big picture of how the application works.
